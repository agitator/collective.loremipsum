Introduction
============

collective.loremipsum is a developer tool to create dummy content and/or
members inside your Plone to play and test with.

It populates the content with text and html retrieved from `loripsum.net`_.
The user data for the dummy members were downloaded from
`fakenamegenerator.com`_.

* After it is installed (via the Plone control panel or the portal_quickinstaller tool), you'll see a new editbar tab labeled "Populate" for all folderish content types. Clicking on this tab brings up a form with parameters for specifying for example the kinds of objects to create, how many and the lorem ipsum rich text formatting.

* You can also register 500 dummy users, but for the moment only by calling the browserview: **@@create-dummy-users**
